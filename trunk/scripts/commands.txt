SoundGrain 4.0 - List of Commands

Menus

File Menu:

New... (Ctrl+N) : 
	Start a new project
Open... (Ctrl+O) :
	Open a previously created .sg file
Open Soundfile... (Shift+Ctrl+O) :
	Import a new sound into the drawing area
Save (Ctrl+S) :
	Save the current state of the project
Save As... (Shift+Ctrl+S) :
	Save the current state of the project in a new .sg file
Open FX Window (Ctrl+P) :
	Open the granulator's parameters window
Open Envelope Window (Ctrl+E) :
	Open a grapher window to modify the shape of the grain's envelope
Run (Ctrl+R) :
	Start/stop processing

Drawing Menu:

Undo, Redo (Ctrl+Z, Shift+Ctrl+Z) :
	Unlimited undo and redo stages for the drawing surface (only trajectories)
Draw Waveform :
	If checked, the loaded soundfile's waveform will be drawn behind the trajectories
Activate Lowpass filter :
	If checked, all points of a trajectory will be filtered using a lowpass filter
	This can be used to smooth out the trajectory or to insert resonance in the curve when the Q is very high
Fill points :
	If checked, spaces between points in a trajectory (especially when stretching the curve) will be filled by additional points
	If unchecked, the number of points in the trajectory won't change, allowing synchronization between similar trajectories
Edition levels :
	Set the modification spread of a trajectory when edited with the mouse (higher values equal narrower transformations)
Reinit counters (Ctrl+T) :
	Re-sync the trajectories' counters (automatically done when audio is started)

Audio Drivers Menu:

Choose the desired driver
The drivers list is updated only on startup

Midi Menu:

Memorize Trajectory (Shift+Ctrl+M) :
	Memorize the state of the selected trajectory
	The ensuing snapshot will be the initial state for trajectories triggered by MIDI notes
Midi Settings... :
	Open the MIDI configuration window

FxBall Menu:

Add Reverb ball (Ctrl+1) :
	Create a reverb region on the drawing surface
Add Delay ball (Ctrl+2) :
	Create a recursive delay region on the drawing surface
Add Disto ball (Ctrl+3) :
	Create a distortion region on the drawing surface
Add Waveguide ball (Ctrl+4)
	Create a resonator region on the drawing surface
Add RingMod ball (Ctrl+5) :
	Create a ring modulation region on the drawing surface
Add Degrade ball (Ctrl+6) :
	Create a degradation region on the drawing surface
Add Harmonizer ball (Ctrl+7) :
	Create an harmonization region on the drawing surface
