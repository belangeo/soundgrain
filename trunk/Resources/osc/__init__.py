    simple API for the Open SoundControl for Python (by Daniel Holth, Clinton
    McChesney --> pyKit.tar.gz file at http://wiretap.stetson.edu)
    Documentation at http://wiretap.stetson.edu/docs/pyKit/

    The main aim of this implementation is to provide with a simple way to deal
    with the OSC implementation that makes life easier to those who don't have
    understanding of sockets. This would not be on your screen without the help
    of Daniel Holth.
