Introduction
============

Welcome to the SoundGrain 5.0.0 documentation.
----------------------------------------------

Soundgrain is a graphical interface where users can draw and edit 
trajectories to control granular sound synthesis. Soundgrain is 
written with Python and WxPython and uses Pyo as its audio engine.

Getting Started
---------------

Getting sound with SoundGrain is as easy as: 
    
- Loading a soundfile on the drawing surface (Menu -> File -> Open Soundfile...).  
- Drawing a granulator trajectory on the drawing surface with the mouse.  
- Activating the audio by clicking on the "Run" button.

Here you should get some output sound!

After that, you can explore by drawing more trajectories (of different kinds),
playing with the granulator controls (Menu -> File -> Open Granulator Controls) 
or with the effects balls (Menu -> FxBall). You can record the generated sound
to the disk with the "Record Settings" section in the bottom of the control
panel.
