Bugs of version 1.0.


= Details =

- Doesn't accept sound with spaces in its path. (fixed in sources)

- Sometimes, we have to wake up some sliders to get sound (because the messages are sent before Csound is ready to receive them). Need to grab a signal from Csound when it's ready to play, to be sure that OSC messages are sent when Csound is ready.
