Bugs of version 1.0.


= Details =

- Doesn't accept sound with spaces in its path. (fixed in sources)

- Recorded sound are always in 16 bits even if the source sound is in 24 bits. (fixed in sources)

- Modules menu must be dactivated when audio is running. (fixed in sources)

- Sometimes, we have to wake up some sliders to get sound (because the messages are sent before Csound is ready to receive them). Need to grab a signal from Csound when it's ready to play, to be sure that OSC messages are sent when Csound is ready. (fixed in sources)

- FFT modules seem to output only mono signal, even with stereo sound. (fixed in sources)
