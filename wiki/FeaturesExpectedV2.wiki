Expected features for version 2.0

= Introduction =

This is a short list of features that I want to add before releasing version 2.0.


= Details =

- Minimal documentation (trajectories manipulation shortcuts).

- Amplitude meter and global volume control.

- Reading of trajectories should be done directly by Csound. The interface will serve only to edit trajectories.

- Each trajectory will have it's own speed and point step.

- Mapping of Y axis on more than one parameter (choice, mix and axis range will be edited by the user)

- Trajectories presets system with interpolation.
