Expected features for version 2.0

= Introduction =

This is a short list of features that I want to add before releasing version 2.0.


= Details =

- Minimal documentation (trajectories manipulation shortcuts). (see Getting started, not completed)

- Amplitude meter and global volume control. (Done)

- Create a preferences file to set manually OSC host and port. This will allow sharing of trajectories with others apps and computers. (Done)

- Each trajectory will have its own speed and point step. (Done)

- Mapping of Y axis on more than one parameter (choice, mix and axis range will be edited by the user). Each trajectory must have its own FX window.

- Trajectories presets system with interpolation.

- Ctrl-Q

- Freeze key per trajectory.

- Input recorder.
