Expected features for version 2.0

= Introduction =

This is a short list of features that I want to add before releasing version 2.0.


= Details =

- Minimal documentation (trajectories manipulation shortcuts). (Done, see Getting started)

- Amplitude meter and global volume control. (Done)

- Reading of trajectories should be done directly by Csound. The interface will serve only to edit trajectories.

- Each trajectory will have its own speed and point step.

- Mapping of Y axis on more than one parameter (choice, mix and axis range will be edited by the user).

- Trajectories presets system with interpolation.

- Create a preferences file to set manually OSC host and port. This will allow sharing of trajectories with others apps and computers. (Done)
