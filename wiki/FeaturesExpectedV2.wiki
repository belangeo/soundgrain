This is a short list of features that I want to add before releasing version 2.0.

- Minimal documentation (trajectories manipulation shortcuts). (see Getting started, not completed)

- Amplitude meter and global volume control. (Done)

- Each trajectory will have its own speed and point step. (Done)

- Ctrl-Q. (Done)

- Freeze key per trajectory. (Done)

- Input recorder. (Done)

- Mapping of Y axis on more than one parameter (choice, mix and axis range will be edited by the user).

- Let the user sets the buffer size in the preferences window.
