= Introduction =

This is a short list of features that I want to add during the development of version 3.0.x 


= Details =

- Fractal trajectories with random choice for path of the ball when lines are splitting.

- Temporary effects with circles user can drag and drop on the drawing surface.

    - multitap delays

    - infinite reverb

- Selected trajectory:

    - Add "add"

----

- Trajectory Behavior changes with objects user can drag and drop on the drawing surface. 

    - wall to change direction of the ball

    - blur to create a moment of confusion and jitter on the trajectory

    - trampoline to give a swing to the ball
