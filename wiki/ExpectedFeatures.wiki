This is a short list of features that I want to add during the development of version 4.0


= Details =

- ~~MIDI support (each note adds a trajectory with a memorized shape)~~

- ~~Temporary effects with circles user can drag and drop on the drawing surface.~~

    - ~~Delay, Reverb, Harmonizer, !RingMod, Waveguide~~

- ~~Display of pointer position~~

- ~~html page for shortcuts and commands~~

- ~~.soundgrain-init file to store current Audio and Midi drivers~~

- ~~Selected trajectory:~~

    - ~~Add "all"~~

    - ~~Bind Delete key to delete the selected trajectory~~

- ~~Remove "Audio on" button, boot and shutdown should be automatic~~

- ~~Add project sampling rate~~

- ~~Record to disk settings:~~

    - ~~File format, sample type, date and time automatically added to filename~~

- ~~Y axis:~~

    - ~~Add "pan" control~~

- ~~Add audio level per trajectory~~

- ~~Always remember the input audio file~~

- ~~Fix number of channels bug~~

- ~~Coreaudio as the default driver on OS X~~

- ~~Windows binary~~

*List of features that I want to add during the development of a future version*


- Fractal trajectories with random choice for path of the ball when lines are splitting.


- Trajectory Behavior changes with objects user can drag and drop on the drawing surface. 

    - wall to change direction of the ball

    - blur to create a moment of confusion and jitter on the trajectory

    - trampoline to give a swing to the ball 

- Automation on trajectory's position

- Algorithmic behavior of trajectories (oscillation, jittering, physical modeling, ...)

- Modulation mask with a .png file

- ~~Multiple sounds in the buffer~~

----
*Need to be fixed*

- Better unicode support

- Give the choice of the audio host

- ~~Support for ASIO driver on Windows~~

- ~~More standard About window~~

- ~~commands window in embeded html window~~

- ~~Fine-tunning of the effects~~
